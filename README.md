# asm-jdk-bridge

A first approach to trial the JDK API for generation and reading of class files by adapting the ASM API. This should serve as a first prof of concept by plugging the reader/writer into existing ASM-based code without much change of code. This also serves as an adapter concept for Byte Buddy where ASM is used vastly.
